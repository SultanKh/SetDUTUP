PCH SLP S0 DBG Report
--------------------

Note that SLPS0 DBG registers are sampled for point-in-time values (not residency values). The Count column contains the number of samples taken where status bit indicated true. Further, Status is only snapped @ C10 entry.

PCH SLP-S0 Residency

The residency reported below could under-report the actual SLP-S0 time when PMC clock throttling occurrs.

Approximated PCH SLP-S0 Residency (corrected for under-reporting)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This residency report uses PMC active time to determine an adjustment that accounts for PMC clock throttling.
 This is considered an approximation because the adjustment is applied as if the throttling occurred uniformly since there is no better data to apply.
The adjustment is based on the difference between collection duration and the sum of the PCH active and not active counters:  System Time - (PMC + SLP-S0)

Adjusted Time: 294.64s
